== Introduction

Welcome to the SunsetERP manual. This manual is intended to provide a comprehensive guide to the SunsetERP project. The
SunsetERP project is a Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that is designed to be easy to use and easy
to deploy. The project is built with Apache OFBiz project, which is a mature open-source ERP system.

SunsetERP differs from Apache OFBiz project in that it is RESTful first and built on top of Quarkus. Making it perfect
for cloud-first and also taking advantage of Quarkus performance with the help of Graalvm.

This makes it easier to integrate SunsetERP with other systems and to build modern web applications on with of it.

That said it does not stop at being RESTful. SunsetERP is outsourcing some of the functionalities to external services that
are better suited to handle the specific functionality. For instance, the SunsetERP project uses the RedHat Keycloak for
authentication and authorization. This allows SunsetERP to focus on the core ERP functionality.

Here is a comprehensive list of the technologies and features used with the SunsetERP project:

* OpenAPI for the RESTful API documentation
* HTMX+RVST+HTMT+PatternFly for the front end
* Quarkus+Graalvm for the backend
* Keycloak for authentication and authorization
* OpenTelemetry for monitoring and tracing
* Kogito for business automation and decision management
* Kie Server for business rules and process automation
* Better integration with ElasticSearch and OpenSearch
* Performance logging
* Added QA tests:
** Load (JMeter)
** Security (OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, and Dependency-Check)
** Performance (Gatling, BCC, JMH, JMH Profiler, JMH Visualizer)
** Integration (Karate)
** Frontend (Cypress)
** API (RestAssured)
** Microservices (Chaos Monkey)
** HTML, CSS, JS (HTMLHint, CSSLint, ESLint, and W3C validation)
** Code (SonarQube, Checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs, FindBugs, and Jacoco)
** Copyright (Apache Rat, Apache Whisker, and Apache License Header) (https://creadur.apache.org/)
** Container (Dockerfile Linter, seccomp, and Docker Bench Security)
* Added documentation export formats (EPUB, and GitHub Wiki)
* GitHub Actions for CI/CD
* GitHub Pages for the documentation
* GitHub Discussions for the community
* GitHub Sponsors for the funding
* GitHub Security Advisories for the security
* GitHub Dependabot for the dependencies
* GitHub CodeQL for the code analysis
* AWS CodeGuru for the code review

Many of the features of the SunsetERP project are still in development.

== Getting Started

To get started with SunsetERP, you will need to have a few things installed on your system. The following sections will
walk you through the process of setting up your development environment.

== Front End

The front end of SunsetERP tries to be as simple as possible. It is built using HTMX, which is a modern approach to
building web applications. HTMX allows you to build web applications that are fast and responsive without having to write
a lot of JavaScript code or any.

HTMX lessen the need for JavaScript so that developers can focus less on the front end and more on the back end. Other
JavaScripts frameworks have a very steep learning curve because of the doubling of state. This goes against RESTful design
principles. There should be one state and for an ERP system, that state should be on the server.

HTMX will let you focus on the server-side and reduce the need for complicate front-end code. No more need to have your
business logic reproduce in the front end.

It does not stop at HTMX. The SunsetERP project also uses RVST with HTMT and PatterFly CSS framework. This reduces even
more the amount of attention that as a developer you need to give to the front end.

All that being said it is not required to work with SunsetERP. Since it is RESTful first any other services can connect to
it and use any type of client-side technology. It can be Android, iOS, or a desktop application.

With this new front end approach the arhitecture of the project is much simpler and differs from the Apache OFBiz. Here
is a reviewed diagram of the architecture:

== Back End

The back end of SunsetERP is built using Quarkus, making it a cloud-native application and taking advantage of Graalvm
performance. Also, it is RESTful first, uses OpenAPI for the RESTful API documentation, and uses Keycloak for
authentication and authorization.

=== Starting Flow

1. Startup.java (org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp)
2. Start.java (org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.start)
  - main() - From here it looks for commands set in the command
  - Based on the command set it evaluates in a switch case and calls the respective command (help, status, shutdown and start)
  - In this context the START command is called
  - This calls the start() method in StartupControlPanel.java (org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.start)
3. StartupControlPanel.java (org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.start)
    - start() - calls
    - Note: so far the code is the same as OFBiz
    - TODO: some code might need to be changed or removed
    - loadContainers() - This method loads the containers
    - loader.load(config, ofbizCommands); - This method loads the configuration and the commands
4. ContainerLoader.java (org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.base.container)
    - load() - This method loads the containers
5. ComponentContainer.java (org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.base.container)
    - init() - This method loads the components
    - The init() calls another init() method in the ComponentContainer.java
    -

==== Simplify Starting Flow
Quarkus -> OFBiz loads the components (resources files) -> OFBiz loads the containers

Components in the context of OFBiz seem to be configuration files that are loaded.

The containers can then respond to the passed commands and configuration files (components) that were loaded.

Containers are listed in the resources ofbiz-component.xml file. The element <container> is used to define a container.

There are different types of loaders for the containers:
- main -
- rmi -
- test -
- load-data -
- main,rmi,load-data,test - Can be multiple loaders

Here is a comprehensive list of the containers used in the OFBiz framework:
- org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.base.container.AdminServerContainer (resources/org/sitenetsoft/sunseterp/framework/base/ofbiz-component.xml)
- org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.base.container.ComponentContainer (not in a ofbiz-component.xml file)
  - TODO: Is it even been loaded
- org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.base.container.NamingServiceContainer (resources/org/sitenetsoft/sunseterp/framework/base/ofbiz-component.xml)
  - TODO: What is it for?
- org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.catalina.container.CatalinaContainer (resources/org/sitenetsoft/sunseterp/framework/catalina/ofbiz-component.xml)
- org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.entity.DelegatorContainer (resources/org/sitenetsoft/sunseterp/framework/entity/ofbiz-component.xml)
- org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.entityext.data.EntityDataLoadContainer (resources/org/sitenetsoft/sunseterp/framework/entityext/ofbiz-component.xml)
  - Handles the loading of data when the command is sent
- org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.service.ServiceContainer (resources/org/sitenetsoft/sunseterp/framework/service/ofbiz-component.xml)
- org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.service.rmi.RmiServiceContainer (resources/org/sitenetsoft/sunseterp/framework/service/ofbiz-component.xml)
  - TODO: Does not seem to be causing errors when maybe it should
  - TODO: What is it for?
  - TODO: Refactoring needed
- org.sitenetsoft.sunseterp.framework.testtools.TestRunContainer (resources/org/sitenetsoft/sunseterp/framework/testtools/ofbiz-component.xml)

Flow diagram of the SunsetERP project:

==== Components

Seemed to be the configuration files that are loaded.

==== Containers

Containers are the classes that are loaded based on the configuration files (componends). They can respond to the passed
commands and/or configuration files (components) that were loaded.

==== Services

Services in OFBiz are the classes that are loaded based on the configuration files (componends). They are often used by
the controller.xml file.

Services in OFBiz have simple configuration files in XML format. From there it can invoke some Java code (TODO: maybe Groovy)
it also can interact with the database via the entity engine. This permits to limit the amount of code required and make
it easier for a low skilled developer to work with the project. It can also be claimed that it low-code.

==== Entities

==== Entity Ext

==== Controller.xml

More often than not the Controller.xml calls a service or services.

It can also configure what is supposed to return to the user in the advent of an error or success.

Again, like services XML configuration files it is simple and easy to understand. It is also low-code.

==== web.xml

Originally the web.xml was used to configure the web application for the servlet container. Since Quarkus does not use
servlet containers the way web.xml is used is different. Some of the

== QA Tests

Quality Assurance (QA) is an important part of software development. The more tests are present for a software the more
chances that issues will be caught earlier. OFBiz came with very good coverage for unit testing but did not have very
good test coverage for the integration, End-to-End, functional, security, licensing, and regulatory standard testing.

=== Integration Testing

In the `config/` directory there is the `compose.yml` files for:

- cache - since SunsetERP is stateless it needs sometimes a place to store temporary information
- db - SunsetERP supports multiple databases (in theory IBM DB2, Oracle DB, and MSSQL are supposed to be supported but no compose configuration are provided for them)
- logging - for grabbing the logs and send them to whatever applications need them
- metrics - some of the logs are for metrics
- search - using the Entity Engine from OFBiz, the schemas will be generated
- sso - Keycloak is the default SSO and connects with SunsetERP with OpenID making this software capable to be integrated with other OpenID SSO services (AWS Cognito, Azure..., Google..., etc) or applications
- tracing - for OpenTelemetry tracing

These compose files help with integration testing. The CI/CD has scripts that automatically test the different integrations.

=== End-to-End Testing

Similar to integration testing but in this context the E2E only test the API endpoints of SunsetERP. Using...

=== Functional Testing

SunsetERP compared to OFBiz is RESTful API first and does not generate HTML anymore. Using a mixture of HTMX+RVST+HTMT
the pages are generated on the frontend. So the functional tests are done with Playwright with the help of Typescripts.

Playwright uses multiple type of browsers to verify that everything works properly.

=== Security Testing



=== Licensing Testing

Verifies all the licenses of all the libraries used in the project to make sure that there are no legal surprises. It
lists all the licenses that are not Open Source.

=== Regulatory Standard

In many nations there are regulations around software and online services. One of them is related to unsubscribe to email
news letters. This test verifies that the software is compliant with the regulations.

== Observability

For observability, the SunsetERP project uses OpenTelemetry for monitoring and tracing. This allows you to monitor the
performance of your application and track down any issues that may arise. It is also useful for Process Mining and BI.

In the context of microservices and multi-cloud environments it has become crucial to have clear and verbose logging.
Without good logging it becomes extremely difficult if not impossible to track down strange behaviour, bugs, or any
other type of issues.
