== Introduction

Welcome to the SunsetERP manual. This manual is intended to provide a comprehensive guide to the SunsetERP project. The
SunsetERP project is a Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that is designed to be easy to use and easy
to deploy. The project is built with Apache OFBiz project, which is a mature open-source ERP system.

SunsetERP differs from Apache OFBiz project in that it is RESTful first and built on top of Quarkus. Making it perfect
for cloud-first and also taking advantage of Quarkus performance with the help of Graalvm.

This makes it easier to integrate SunsetERP with other systems and to build modern web applications on with of it.

That said it does not stop at being RESTful. SunsetERP is outsourcing some of the functionalities to external services that
are better suited to handle the specific functionality. For instance, the SunsetERP project uses the RedHat Keycloak for
authentication and authorization. This allows SunsetERP to focus on the core ERP functionality.

Here is comprehensive list of the technologies and features used with the SunsetERP project:
- OpenAPI for the RESTful API documentation
- HTMX+RVST+HTMT+PatternFly for the front end
- Quarkus+Graalvm for the backend
- Keycloak for authentication and authorization
- OpenTelemetry for monitoring and tracing
- Kogito for business automation and decision management
- Kie Server for business rules and process automation
- Better integration with ElasticSearch and OpenSearch
- Performance logging
- Added QA tests:
   - Load (JMeter)
   - Security (OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, and Dependency-Check)
   - Performance (Gatling, BCC, JMH, JMH Profiler, JMH Visualizer)
   - Integration (Karate)
   - Frontend (Cypress)
   - API (RestAssured)
   - Microservices (Chaos Monkey)
   - HTML, CSS, JS (HTMLHint, CSSLint, ESLint, and W3C validation)
   - Code (SonarQube, Checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs, FindBugs, and Jacoco)
   - Copyright (Apache Rat, Apache Whisker, and Apache License Header) (https://creadur.apache.org/)
   - Container (Dockerfile Linter, seccomp, and Docker Bench Security)
- Added documentation export formats (EPUB, and GitHub Wiki)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- GitHub Pages for the documentation
- GitHub Discussions for the community
- GitHub Sponsors for the funding
- GitHub Security Advisories for the security
- GitHub Dependabot for the dependencies
- GitHub CodeQL for the code analysis
- AWS CodeGuru for the code review

Many of the features of the SunsetERP project are still in development.

== Getting Started

To get started with SunsetERP, you will need to have a few things installed on your system. The following sections will
walk you through the process of setting up your development environment.

== Front End

The front end of SunsetERP tries to be as simple as possible. It is built using HTMX, which is a modern approach to
building web applications. HTMX allows you to build web applications that are fast and responsive without having to write
a lot of JavaScript code or any.

HTMX lessen the need for JavaScript so that developers can focus less on the front end and more on the back end. Other
JavaScripts frameworks have a very steep learning curve because of the doubling of state. This goes against RESTful design
principles. There should be one state and for an ERP system, that state should be on the server.

HTMX will let you focus on the server-side and reduce the need for complicate front-end code. No more need to have your
business logic reproduce in the front end.

It does not stop at HTMX. The SunsetERP project also uses RVST with HTMT and PatterFly CSS framework. This reduces even
more the amount of attention that as a developer you need to give to the front end.

All that being said it is not required to work with SunsetERP. Since it is RESTful first any other services can connect to
it and use any type of client-side technology. It can be Android, iOS, or a desktop application.

With this new front end approach the arhitecture of the project is much simpler and differs from the Apache OFBiz. Here
is a reviewed diagram of the architecture:
