== Introduction

Welcome to the SunsetERP manual. This manual is intended to provide a comprehensive guide to the SunsetERP project. The
SunsetERP project is a web-based Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system that is designed to be easy to use and easy
to deploy. The project is built on-top of the Apache OFBiz project, which is a mature open-source ERP system.

That is nice, but what is the difference between SunsetERP and Apache OFBiz? The main difference is that SunsetERP is
RESTful first. Apache OFBiz was designed in the early 2000s and is based on a traditional web application architecture.

This makes it easier to integrate SunsetERP with other systems and to build modern web applications on top of it.

That said it does not stop at being RESTful. SunsetERP is outsourcing some of the functionality to external services that
are better suited to handle the specific functionality. For example, the SunsetERP project uses the RedHat Keycloak for
authentication and authorization. This allows SunsetERP to focus on the core ERP functionality.

== Getting Started

To get started with SunsetERP, you will need to have a few things installed on your system. The following sections will
walk you through the process of setting up your development environment.

== Front End

The front end of SunsetERP tries to be as simple as possible. It is built using HTMX, which is a modern approach to
building web applications. HTMX allows you to build web applications that are fast and responsive without having to write
a lot of JavaScript code or any.

HTMX lessen the need for JavaScript so that developers can focus less on the front end and more on the back end. Other
JavaScripts frameworks have a very steep learning curve because of the doubling of state. This goes against RESTful design
principles. There should be one state and for an ERP system, that state should be on the server.

HTMX will let you focus on the server-side and reduce the need for complicate front-end code. No more need to have your
business logic reproduce in the front end.

It does not stop at HTMX. The SunsetERP project also uses RVST with HTMT and PatterFly CSS framework. This reduces even
more the amount of attention that as a developer you need to give to the front end.

All that being said it is not required to work with SunsetERP. Since it is RESTful first any other services can connect to
it and use any type of client-side technology. It can be Android, iOS, or a desktop application.

With this new front end approach the arhitecture of the project is much simpler and differs from the Apache OFBiz. Here
is a reviewed diagram of the architecture:
