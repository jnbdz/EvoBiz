# ðŸŒ‡ SunsetERP ðŸŒ‡

**WARNING:** This project is still in development. It is not ready for production use or any use at all. But help is always welcome!

SunsetERP is based on a heavily modified version of [OFBiz](https://ofbiz.apache.org/) to run on Quarkus.

Here are some of the features of SunsetERP/OFBiz:
- Accounting (agreements, invoicing, vendor management, general ledger)
- Asset maintenance
- Catalogue and product management
- Facility and warehouse management system (WMS)
- Manufacturing execution / manufacturing operations management (MES/MOM)
- Order processing
- Inventory management, automated stock replenishment etc.
- Content management system (CMS)
- Human resources (HR)
- People and group management
- Project management
- Sales force automation
- Work effort management
- Electronic point of sale (ePOS)
- Electronic commerce (eCommerce)
- Scrum (development) (Scrum software development support)
- *and many more to come...* 

SunsetERP benefits from OFBiz usage of standard business data models.

## Delta with OFBiz
- SunsetERP is based on Quarkus
  - Why? Quarkus is faster and makes Java projects more lightweight.
- SunsetERP is API first (REST and SOAP)
  - Why? It makes it easier to integrate with other systems and create an SPA Single Page Application.
  - That being said the UI will be made with [PatternFLy](https://www.patternfly.org/) (of [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/)) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). Because it looks way better than OFBiz UI. Sorry.
- SunsetERP is using a reactive architecture
- SunsetERP can be used in a microservices architecture more easily
- SunsetERP is using a different authentication system
  - Why? It makes it easier to integrate with other systems, to reduce the attack surface and to have something else not to worry about.
  - It will soon be able to work out of the box with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/).
    - Keycloak supports SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0 and LDAP. So why reinvent the wheel?
  - So for more SSO and authentication options you will have to use Keycloak or some other system.

## What stays the same
- It is important to not stray away to far from the original OFBiz architecture and data model. This is to make sure that the project stays compatible with OFBiz plugins that already exist.
- It is important that it does not feel like a different project.
- The Data Models will stay untouched, but we might add new ones if need be.
- Entity Engine will stay untouched.
- Since Quarkus is used some changes to the usage of Groovy is to be expected.

### Why keep SOAP?
- SOAP is still used in many places and is still a very valid way of communicating with other systems. It is also very easy to use with Java.
- SOAP in the world of accounting, banking and finance is still very much used. It is also used in the world of logistics and supply chain management.

## Project Status
Still in dev mode.

## Nice to have
- https://kogito.kie.org/ (BPM and BRM)
- Have a similar plugin system as Keycloak
- Adapt ofbiz-plugins to this new setup
- Adapt it for better Process Mining

## Notes about Paths:
```groovy
groovyScripts {
        groovy {
            srcDirs += getDirectoryInActiveComponentsIfExists('src/main/groovy')
            compileClasspath += sourceSets.main.compileClasspath
            compileClasspath += sourceSets.main.output
        }
```
Might need to investigate: 
- `sourceSets.main.compileClasspath`
- `sourceSets.main.output`

## TODO
- [x] Change the name of the directories to use `sunseterp` instead of `ofbiz`

  - [ ] Refactor and make sure the code is being merged properly
  - [ ] Refactor CLASSPATH (`System.getProperty("java.class.path");`)
    - [ ] Analyse is `component-load.xml` for `applications/` and `framework/` are being removed from Gradle level
    - [ ] Add the different paths for framework and applications since we are dividing not like OFBiz that merges them
      - [ ] Document this somewhere

  - [ ] Refactor the tasks
    - [ ] Plugin management tasks
    - [ ] Clean tasks
    - [ ] Others

- [ ] Replace but also keep `component-load.xml` with `component-load.properties` using cascading
- [ ] Replace the other *XML* format configuration file with `.properties` using cascading (trying to standarized all the configurations with what already exists with Quarkus) (keep support for *XML* because of not wanting to break plugins *"for now"*)
- [ ] Replace and keep Entities with YAML (some *XML* are too complicated to be readable and usable with `.properties`)
- [ ] Nice to have: little `Gradle` script to replace *XML* with `.properties` or YAML and check the rest of the code to see what else needs to be refactored to work with SunsetERP (since the merging will be different)
- [ ] Add load all data
  - [ ] Analyse

- [ ] Add support for the latest Java version (Quarkus 3.9 the version currently used only supports Java version 17 and 21... So the version switch should be to Java 21)
- [ ] Change library `AWT` for image modification (e.g.: `net.coobird.thumbnailator`, `org.apache.xmlgraphics`, `Twelvemonkeys ImageIO`) - Quarkus might not support AWT fully, and it is a bit old

  - [ ] Analyse
- [ ] Test for legal (copyright)
  - [ ] Analyse (GitHub workflow)

  - [ ] Analyse if possible to use `@decorators` to clean up the code and modernize it
  - [ ] It needs to be possible to call other applications without needing to `import` the code (should be possible to `import` or do a RestFul call)
    - [ ] Analyse
- [ ] Create a separate library for the framework and give it a name and each application should have their own repo
- [ ] Divorce *entity engine* from *applications* so that a Gradle script can build the data model in a separate env like CI/CD without needing to include all the code in the application code (lets make this light)
- [ ] Re-write all the demos to support the new structure
- [ ] Add AI for QA
  - [ ] Analyse (what is in the market)
  - [ ] Add AI for testing
  - [ ] Add AI for code review (AWS CodeGuru)
  - [ ] Security testing AI (AWS GuardDuty)
- [ ] Come up with some new ideas!

Abstraction: 
> 1. A developer should be able to easily build a ERP microservices env.
> 2. A developer should not need to put too much energy on the front end and not have any business (or very little) in the front-end (no more Angular and React or whatever else that causes people to replicate everything on the frontend (INSANITY!!))
> 3. API first (HATEOAS)
> 4. Decoupling should be easy
> 5. Make applications lighter and more portable
> 6. Add features to be more attractive vs Salesforce and Odoo
> 7. Better testing to catch more issues (currently there are broken parts of OFBiz and for some reason it hasn't been caught)
> 8. So in other words, we need better QA
> 9. Demos help others see what can be done and how

Here is what the architecture should look like after the refactoring:

## Getting Started
This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```shell script
./gradlew quarkusDev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:
```shell script
./gradlew build
```
It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `build/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that itâ€™s not an _Ã¼ber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `build/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar build/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _Ã¼ber-jar_, execute the following command:
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _Ã¼ber-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar build/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: 
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using: 
```shell script
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.package.type=native -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./build/sunseterp-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/gradle-tooling.
